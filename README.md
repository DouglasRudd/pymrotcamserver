# pymrotcamserver
Simple 2-axis motorized rotating camera server on raspberry pi , motion parts depends on pigpio library.<br> 
Camera capture function also can be tested on non-pi enviroment by the helps of cv2 (python wrapper of OpenCV).<br>
Going to have some fun features further , such as motorized face-tracking , click-and-set image center , or do some further complex image process.<br>
